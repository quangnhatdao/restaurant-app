# Restaurant App - Season 1
This season implements the Restaurant App with the following tech stack:

+ Languages
    - HTML
    - Javascript
    - CSS
    - Python
    - SQL
+ For frontend
    - Vue
    - Nuxt
    - Boot
    - Axios
+ For backend
    - Django
    - SQLite
    
Nonetheless, there are some remaining issues:
+ The UI looks crude
+ Authentication/Authorization is not (yet) implemented
+ Domain logic is still complete
+ The backend API is not RESTful (lacks hypermedia), therefore frontend has to use fix URLs

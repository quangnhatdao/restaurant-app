# restaurant-app
I learn new programming languages or technologies mostly via tutorials. However, the examples in those tutorials derive from different domains. For example, a tutorial can be about creating an app for managing employees or showing a list of fruits. This makes it difficult to realize an idea requiring different languages/technologies. Therefore, I use this project to employ different tools to make an app. The ideas behind this app mostly stay consistent so I only need to focus on using the technologies instead of the domain.

## What does Restaurant App do?
This app allows users to manage restaurants and their dishes. To be more specific, users should be able to create, update, read, delete restaurants and their dishes. Restaurant should have a name, an address, a set of dishes, image, etc. Nonetheless, the concrete requirements may vary for different seasons.

## What are seasons?
Season is a sub-project that I implement Restaurant App with a set of specific languages/technologies. The app, its functionalities, its design may different in each season. Notwithstanding, the core idea, which is allowing users to manage restaurants, stay unchanged. For instance, season 1 comprises a front-end and a back-end system. The tech stack is Vue, Nuxt, Bootstrap for frontend and Django, MySQL for backend

## One more reason to pursue this project?
Imagine that a solid number of seasons has been implemented. If I were to work in another project, e.g., a Bank app or Hospital app, I would only need to focus on adapting a chosen season to the new domain. In my opinion, that should be easier that starting from scratch.

## Interested? Clone this down and try out?
I really hope that many people will participate in this new form of "Learn to code". Also, if something is wrong in the code, I would be so glad if you let me know.

# HAVE A NICE DAY!
